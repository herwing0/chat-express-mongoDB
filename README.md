Steps to run :

1- clone proyect

2- update npm 

3- Optional Point to a DB of your preference ( I used a MongoDB personal test base) on the dbUrl variable ( Line 13 server.js)

3- cast node server.js on terminal

4- Go to local http://localhost:5000/, or configure the var port on server.js to match your preference port.

This proyect is adapted to run localy, but i made it to be hosted on Heroku pointing towards a MongoDB.

This chat consumes Express, Socket io and mongoose for backend.
And Boostrap for front end.
